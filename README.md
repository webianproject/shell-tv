# Webian Shell TV

**Note:** Development is currently continuing downstream at https://github.com/krellian/kiosk

A graphical shell for the web (TV version).

This application is for interactive kiosks and digital signage which can be remotely controlled over the Internet.

It acts as both a web client and a web server in order to render web content and expose system services via the Web of Things.

## Getting Started

To get started hacking on Webian Shell TV first make sure that you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

Then simply clone the Shell Kiosk repository from GitHub and run it.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/webianproject/shell-tv.git
$ cd shell-tv
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
The client should then start up full screen and the remote web interface should be running at http://localhost:8080

The web client uses Electron and the web server uses NodeJS.
